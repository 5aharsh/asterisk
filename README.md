# Asterisk* Password Vault #
----------------------------

### Encrypted. Light Weight. Minimal ###

Asterisk* is a minimalistic password vault that helps you organise your passwords on your desktop offline. Create a database of your own right away and secure it with one master password. Content inside your database is encrypted with AES-128 bit encryption which makes it impossible for any intruder to extract your passwords from the database. With all that security, it's super easy to use.

While using Asterisk* you are the ultimate owner of your passwords. You can create the backup of your Asterisk* Database, or even keep it in any mobile storage and view its content using this application in any other desktop. Although, you'll have to make sure to **always** keep your master password a secret and **never** forget it. Since, for security purpose, there is no possible way to recover it. Thus, your master password is your ultimate key that you can't afford to loose.

### Downloading only Asterisk.exe will be fine - [Direct download link to Asterisk.exe].
